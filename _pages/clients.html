    <p class="pt-2 mb-2 lg:text-2xl w-2/3">
        As one of the nation's leading importers of fresh and frozen seafood, <a href="https://www.beaverstreetfisheries.com/about-us.php" class="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beaver Street Fisheries</a>
        needed a technology partner that could help them modernize their systems and processes as they 
        have continued to grow and expand their business.
    </p>

    <p class="pt-2 mb-2 lg:text-2xl w-2/3">
        We have worked with Beaver Street Fisheries over the last decade to develop numerous custom software solutions 
        that have helped them manage inventory, forecast purchasing, improved internal operations, and automated a complicated procurement process 
        to continuously supply their customers with fresh seafood. These systems have helped them improve
        efficiency, reduce costs, and increase customer satisfaction.
    </p>

    <p class="pt-2 mb-2 lg:text-2xl w-2/3">
        We continue to work with Beaver Street Fisheries to help them stay ahead of the curve in the seafood industry. 
        We are proud to be their technology partner and look forward to helping them grow and succeed in the future.
    </p>
