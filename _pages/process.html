        <p class="p-6 text-3xl font-bold text-center">
            Our system is comprised of three main phases: Discovery, Design, and Delivery.
        </p>

        <p class="p-6 text-3xl font-bold text-center">
            Each phase contains specific activities focused on refining understanding and ensuring
            alignment with your unique needs.
        </p>

        <p class="p-6 text-3xl font-bold text-center">
            At the end of each phase you can expect value delivered in the form of artifacts or outcomes that
            feed into the next steps in the process.
        </p>
        <p class="p-6 text-3xl font-bold text-center">
            Core to it all are communication, collaboration, and a focus on continuous learning.

            Without learning, we cannot improve. Without improvement, we cannot deliver value.

            <p>
                Discovery is about understanding your business deeply before we write a line of code.
            </p>

            <p>
                We learn about the behaviors and operations that the software will replicate or enhance,
                forming a detailed picture of how it can best serve your organization.
            </p>

            <p>
                This mutual understanding establishes the foundation upon which all other phases are built,
                setting the direction for meaningful design and valuable delivery.
            </p>


            <h1 class="text-3xl mt-6">What Do I Need to Do?</h1>
            <p>
                You can expect to engage in a series of activities that will help us understand your business,
                its goals, and the people who will use the software.
            </p>
            <p>
                These activities include interviews, workshops, and research, all designed to build a detailed picture
                of how the software can best serve your organization and its people.
            </p>

            <h1 class="text-3xl mt-6">What Do I Get Out of This?</h1>

            <p>
                The Discovery phase produces a number of key artifacts that will guide the design and development of the
                software.
            </p>

            <p>
                These artifacts may include user personas, user stories, and a detailed project plan.
            </p>

            <p>
                By the end of the Discovery phase, we will have a shared understanding of your business,
                its goals, and the people who use the software,
                setting the stage for a successful design and development process.
            </p>

            <h1 class="text-3xl mt-6">What is the Risk of Skipping Discovery?</h1>
            <p>
                Skipping the Discovery phase can lead to misunderstandings and misalignments that can derail the
                project.
            </p>

            <p>
                By taking the time to understand your business deeply before we write a line of code,
                we can ensure that the software we create is custom-built to meet your unique needs.

            <p>
                Design is about taking what we learned during Discovery and turning those ideas into 
                artifacts that will guide the development of the software.
            </p>
            <p>
                These artifacts serve as blueprints for the software and allow us to see what the software may 
                look like and how it might function before it is built.
            </p>

            <h1 class="text-3xl mt-6">What Do I Need To Do?</h1>
            <p>

        <p class="pt-2 mb-2 lg:text-2xl w-11/12 lg:w-2/3">

            Our system of delivery is designed to bring clarity and confidence to custom
            software development, making each phase purposeful and aligned with your unique needs.
            We start with understanding your business deeply before we write a line of code.
            Once we have a mutual understanding or a shared vision, we move into delivery.
            Maintaining and refining your software for the long term, our approach ensures
            lasting value.

        <ol class="pt-2 mb-2 lg:text-xl w-11/12 lg:w-2/3">
            <li>
                1. Achieving Mutual Understanding
                The journey begins with a shared understanding of your business, its goals, and the people who use the
                software. This phase is critical: we learn about the behaviors and operations that the software will
                replicate or enhance, forming a detailed picture of how it can best serve your organization. This mutual
                understanding establishes the foundation upon which all other phases are built, setting the direction
                for
                meaningful design and impactful development.
            </li>
            <li>
                2. Design
                Once we’re aligned on your needs, we transition into the Design phase, refining and organizing the
                insights
                from the Understanding phase. Here, we work collaboratively to define the software’s features and user
                interactions. Key artifacts like user flow diagrams, wireframes, and a foundational architecture are
                produced, offering a clear blueprint for the software’s functionality and user experience. This phase
                translates ideas into actionable plans, readying the project for efficient and informed development.
            </li>
            <li>
                3. Delivery
                With design plans in hand, we move into Delivery, the phase where the software itself is brought to
                life.
                Our team writes the code, continually seeks feedback, and adapts as needed to maintain alignment with
                your
                evolving understanding and priorities. This iterative approach lets us refine our understanding and
                improve
                the design with each development cycle. By engaging with your team throughout the process, we ensure
                that
                the software remains in step with your needs and changes in the business environment.
            </li>
            <li>
                4. Maintenance
                After launch, the focus shifts to Maintenance, where we support and evolve your software to stay
                valuable
                over time. We employ four types of maintenance:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Corrective: Fixing any issues that arise.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Adaptive: Adjusting the software to changes in the operating environment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Preventive: Anticipating potential issues to prevent future disruptions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Perfective: Enhancing performance and features to optimize the software’s value.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-6">
                    This phase ensures that the software remains secure, efficient, and perfectly tuned to your needs
                    well beyond its
                    initial release.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                5. Optional: Research & Development
                For clients looking to explore new possibilities, our Research & Development (R&D) cycles offer a
                flexible way to
                experiment with new ideas. R&D can happen alongside regular development or independently, creating a
                sandbox for
                innovation that can lead to future features, enhancements, or even entirely new software products. This
                optional
                phase opens up new avenues, allowing your business to stay on the cutting edge of technology.
            </li>
