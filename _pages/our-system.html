            Our system is comprised of three main phases: Discovery, Design & Engineering, and Maintenance and Support.
        </p>

        <p class="p-6 text-3xl font-bold text-center">
            Each phase contains clear goals and deliverables fulfilled through
            specific activities focused on refining understanding and ensuring
            alignment with your unique needs.
        </p>

        <p class="p-6 text-3xl font-bold text-center">
            Core to it all are communication, collaboration, and a focus on continuous learning.

            Without learning, we cannot improve. Without improvement, we cannot deliver value.
